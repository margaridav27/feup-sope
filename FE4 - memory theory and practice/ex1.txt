FIRST FIT 
In the first fit approach is to allocate the first free partition or hole large enough which
can accommodate the process. It finishes after finding the first suitable free partition.

memory  10      4       20      18      7       9       12      15
request                 12

memory  10      4       8      18      7       9       12      15
request 10                

memory  4       8      18      7       9       12      15
request                9

memory  4       8      9      7       9       12      15

advantages:
- fastest algorithm because it searches as little as possible

disadvantages:
- the remaining unused memory areas left after allocation become waste if it is too smaller,
thus request for larger memory requirement cannot be accomplished

-------------------------------------------------------------------

BEST FIT
The best fit deals with allocating the smallest free partition which meets the requirement 
of the requesting process. This algorithm first searches the entire list of free partitions
and considers the smallest hole that is adequate. It then tries to find a hole which is close
to actual process size needed.

request                                                 12

memory  10      4       20      18      7       9       15
request 10   

memory  4       20      18      7       9       15
request                                 9

memory  4       20      18      7       15

advantages:
- memory utilization is much better than first fit as it searches the smallest free partition 
first available

disadvantages:
- it is slower and may even tend to fill up memory with tiny useless holes

-------------------------------------------------------------------

WORST FIT
In worst fit approach is to locate largest available free portion so that the portion left
will be big enough to be useful. It is the reverse of best fit.

memory  10      4       8      18      7       9       12      15
request                        10    

memory  10      4       8      8      7       9       12      15
request                                                       9

memory  10      4       8      8      7       9       12      6

advantages:
- reduces the rate of production of small gaps

disadvantages:
- if a process requiring larger memory arrives at a later stage then it cannot be accommodated 
as the largest hole is already split and occupied
